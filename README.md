# cloth-prediction-and-classification
Cloth prediction and classification involve analyzing images or data of clothing items to predict specific attributes (such as color, pattern, or material) and classify them into categories (such as type, style, or occasion). This process typically uses machine learning algorithms to accurately identify and categorize clothing items.
